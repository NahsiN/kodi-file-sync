# KodiFileSync ðŸ”„
If using a central database to manage your Kodi database(s), this project aims to sync 
_certain_ video file metadata across Kodi versions. The metadata includes resume bookmarks, 
player settings, play counts, last played, etc. The metadata excludes metadata such as movie names, ratings, actors, genres, etc. 


# Installation
1. Clone this repo onto your machine and use it as your working directory for everything below.
2. Create a `.env` file using `touch .env`. Populate it with your MySQL server credentials. For e.g.
```
MYSQL_HOST = "000.000.0.000"
MYSQL_USER = "0000"
MYSQL_PASSWORD = "0000"
MYSQL_PORT = 0000
```
3. Set up a Python virtual environment using a virtual env tool of your choice (venv, virtualenv, conda, poetry,pipenv, pyflow). See [comparison](https://dev.to/bowmanjd/python-tools-for-managing-virtual-environments-3bko) 
I will be using venv. 
    - Create a virtual enviroment called kfs in your project directory `python -m venv kfs`
    - Activate the virtual environment using `source kfs/bin/activate`
    - Install pip-tools in the virutal environment `pip install pip-tools`
4. Install dependencies
    - Use the `{env}-requirements.txt` appropriate for the python environment you're in, namely your OS and python version.
    - If it exists then run `pip-sync requirements/{env}-requirements.txt` For e.g for me, I'm running Python3.8 on linux so I run `pip-sync requirements/linux-py3.8-requirements.txt`
        - If not, then create the requirements.txt file by `pip-compile  --output-file requirements/{os}-{python-version}-requirements.txt` and then run `pip-sync` as usual
5. Modify the `config.yaml`
    - Enter the kodi version and associated databases you'd like to keep in sync. Refer to the [wiki](https://kodi.wiki/view/Databases) to find out the default database names for different Kodi versions. NOTE: One line per Kodi version. Syncing multiple databases per Kodi version to another Kodi version is not yet supported.
6. Run Script `python sync.py` This will create the database, triggers, inserts, events necessary for file syncing
7. Deactivate using `deactivate`. Test it out

# Troubleshooting

# Known Issues/Limitations
- During the setup if the databases are out of sync e.g. different bookmark resume points, they will remain out of sync until a file is accessed in either of the Kodi versions post setup. 
- Only one user per Kodi database is supported at the moment. You can't sync multiple users in your Kodi database across versions
- Since a file is defined by its full filesystem path, the same file across different filesystems are treated as different files. This problem is non-existent when using network file paths. 

# Support
- Open up an issue or ask on the Kodi forum and please be patient. I will try my best :)
